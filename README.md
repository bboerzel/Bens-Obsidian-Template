# Ben´s Obsidian Template
Hey there, this is how I have setup Obsidian as my second brain / personal knowledge management system / task manager.
Maybe it helps you getting started or inspires you for your Osidian setup. I added some sample content so it makes more sense.
For more ideas, check out the obsidian forum:  [Latest Share & showcase topics - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/c/share-showcase/9)

**Best thing you donwload this repository and open it up as vault in obsidian!**

## Knowledge Management
My personal knowledge management system (pkms) is inspired by Niklas Luhmanns **Zettelkasten** system but not as strictly followed. I try breaking stuff down and linking them together.

I save ideas and concept as #💡  [[📃bit notes]]. Yeah I´m from the IT world and since bits are the smallest information unit, I find it more fitting as the more common term **atomic notes**.

HowTos, Tutorials, Runbooks, Code Snippets and stuff that is not "wiki article like" as bit notes ends in my #🧰  [[📃Knowledge Base Notes]], to remember how stuff is done. 

When I find an interesting piece of information it gets saved as  #🌍 [[📃Source Notes]] with some initial notes and remarks. This notes are also categorized by there type / where they come from.
- #🌍/🎬 video / youtube / movie 
- #🌍/💻 website / blog
- #🌍/🎧 podcast
- #🌍/📖 magazine article
- #🌍/📃 scientific papers 
- #🌍/📅 events / presentations / workshops / weninars etc.

Books are basically also source notes but they have their own place as #📚 [[📃literature notes]]. Also categorized with subtags by genre.
I found a neat scripts which imports your books from http://goodreads.com/ [[#^866cdf]].

New notes / ideas / thoughts are created in the inbox from where they get edited and moved.

Another part of my pkms are the [[📓Study Notes]], here I take notes of things I´m currently learing and transform them afterwards into bit and knowledge base notes.

I´m also thinking about setting up a **digital garden** to plant ideas, growing and harvest them to output. So far I only manage "hard facts" / knowledge but less ideas and thoughts.

## Productivity
Besides knowledge I handle my tasks / projects in Obsidian.

#🧑 [[📃people notes]]  are a crossover between the knowledge and productivity setup. Authors, youtubers etc. landing there besides people I work with. Through the linking feature of obsidian it is easy to find source notes / books a person has created or see who was with me in meetings or works with me on projects for example.

Another big part are my [[📃daily notes]]. Here I add the tasks for that day, take [[📃Meeting Notes]] and all other notes that come up over the day. At the end of the week I summarize the most impact full topics that week in weekly notes. They go in monthly notes and they in yearly (eg [[2021]] ) ones. So I can get a quick overview what happend that week / month and easy keep track of things.

In the [[🤹Projects]] I handle the projects I´m working on. In the subfolders are the notes and other stuff regarding the project. One note is a overview note with the people involved, tasks, notes, meetings and links. 

### Workflow
I have the QuickAdd Templater Template [[#^e972a8]] Plugin installed and configured for the Hotkey ALT+C.

From here I can very quickly add tasks that come up to the [[001 ✔️ToDo]] Overview under the inbox header.  In this index I see all open tasks in the vault from different notes, notes with the tag #todo that have to be worked on and other tasks added directly. 
From here I can pick what I want to work on that day and add them to my [[📃daily notes]] and are getting worked on.

To capture thoughts and ideas I want to get back later I add them via QuickAdd to the [[002 💭Top of Mind]] index. Here are all the things I want to keep in mind, short term.

Websites I want to save go to the [[090 🔖Bookmarks]] and Articles / Videos I want to read/watch when I have time for it are added to the [[091 🔖Read Later]], from where they transform in [[📃Source Notes]] when read/watched.

Information / ideas / concepts are getting extracted from here and [[📃bit notes]] are written and saved. They later can inspire to create some sort of output like blog posts.

The entry point of the vault is the [[000 📇Index]], it links to all the maps, lists, journal entries and so on. In the graph view it´s the central hub of everything.
