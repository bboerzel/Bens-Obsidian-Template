# Wovon handelt das Buch?
Das Buch handelt davon, wie ich mit BÃ¼chern umgehe, damit ich den Inhalt versthehen, verinnerlichen und mit weiteren BÃ¼chern meinen Horizont erweitern kann.
Es zeigt Techniken auf um strukturiert, zuerst einen Ãœberblick Ã¼ber ein Buch zu erhalten, um anschlieÃŸend die Kernaussagen und Ideen zu erkennen.


Es wird von vier Lesestadien berichtet.
1. [[Elementares Lesen]]
2. [[Querlesen]]
3. [[Analytisches Lesen]]
4. [[Synoptisches Lesen]]

Mache dir das Buch dein Eigen.
[[Wie markiere ich ein Buch]]

Beim lesen solltest du immer einen Stift in der Hand haben und ein Blatt Papier daneben liegen haben. Mache dir Notizen wÃ¤hrend des lesens!
Es gibt drei Unterscheidliche Arten von Notizen.
1. Strukturelle Notizen -> zum  Querlesen
2. Konzeptuelle Notizen -> zum Analytischen Lesen
3. Dialektische Notizen -> zum Synoptishen Lesen

Viele Leser bleiben auf diesem Niveau stehen, und lesen nur im ersten Stadium, dem elementaren Lesens.
